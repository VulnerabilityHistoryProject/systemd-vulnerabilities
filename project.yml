description: |
  "systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a replacement for sysvinit." -systemd website

vulnerabilities_description: |
  These vulnerabilities are collected from the National Vulnerabilities Database, acknowledged by the developers.
developers_description: |
  The following is a list of developers who are involved in code that was found to be vulnerable. Specifically, developers end up here if they were the author of a commit to code that was, at some point in time, fixed for a vulnerability. Note that this is NOT a comprehensive list.

# A file name that ends with this string is considered to be source code
# The way I found these was to do this at the root of the git repo
#
# find -type f | cut -c 3- | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq > ~/systemd_exts.txt
#
# Then filtered by hand. Remove anything compressed, binary, dev-tools, etc.
